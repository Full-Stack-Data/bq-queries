# BigQuery Analytics

## Who is this for and what does it do?
For people who want to understand how users are interacting with their products and content â€“ specifically when these users span multiple countries, regions, socioeconomic, and demographic classes

I don't know exactly what the use-cases will be (need to see what users ask for). But roughly, I should be able to answer:
- what kind of content is doing well where
- what kind of actions is a user taking on a page
- what kind of users are consuming what kind of content

## Facts I know
- Some rows will be duplicated (i.e., more than two rows can have the same pageid)
- Some rows might not be updated by the time I finish running a query for an hour
- Cloudflare Workers cannot connect to an SQL server directly. So will have to use PostgREST instead to expose an SQL server as a REST API

## Purpose
To summarize key stats in BigQuery and save them to an SQL server, and then query the SQL server via APIs for a dashboard
